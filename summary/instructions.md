But... it's not the end! In this workshop you used just a few widgets from the 
big list of all `ImplicitlyAnimatedWidgets`. Using the code from this 
tutorial, you can try other widgets. 

For animating changes in widget's position:
- [AnimatedPadding](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedPadding-class.html)
- [AnimatedSlide](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedSlide-class.html)
- [AnimatedPositioned](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedPositioned-class.html)

For animating transitions between two widgets:
- [AnimatedSwitcher](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedSwitcher-class.html)
- [AnimatedCrossFade](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedCrossFade-class.html)

For animating changes in widget's size:
- [AnimatedSize](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedSize-class.html)
- [AnimatedScale](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedScale-class.html)

For animating text changes:
- [AnimatedDefaultTextStyle](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedDefaultTextStyle-class.html)
