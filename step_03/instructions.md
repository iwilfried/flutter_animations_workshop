# Animate the box using AnimatedContainer

Now is the time to finally create some animations!

The widget already changes its state, so now the last step is to replace 
`Container` with an `AnimatedContainer`. 

<!-- Not to be picky, but would it make sense to make the duration configurable 
via the MyApp constructor, with a default duration? Then, the _MyAppState class
 would use widget.duration? That might be a nice way to show folks how to make
  configuration durations? Dunno, random thought :) Ignore if it's too 
  distracting from the goal! -->
First, create a new `Duration` instance at the top of the class (line #18)

```dart
final _duration = const Duration(milliseconds: 500);
```

And replace `Container` with an `AnimatedContainer` (line #31)

```dart

child: AnimatedContainer(
  duration: _duration,
  width: _width,
  height: _height,
  color: _color,
),

```

And voil√†! Now, when you run the app and tap on the button, the rectangle's 
size and color should change with a smooth animation.
