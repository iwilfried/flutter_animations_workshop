# Introduction Flutter AppBar Widget

AppBar is a material widget in flutter which is most commonly used in almost all kinds of applications. Appbar will display the toolbar that we see in every application. It also displays several widgets like the `title` of the screen, the back button `[](image.png)` / close button `(‘x‘)` & actions like search, etc.  



The actions are indicated using icon buttons. It is also responsible for displaying a PopupMenuButton ( overflow menu ) which is used for actions that are performed less frequently.  


In this workshop you're going to learn how to develop and modify the AppBar widget.
