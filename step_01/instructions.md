# Convert into a Stateful Widget

As mentioned before, implicit animations work automatically when you change a
property value on your widget. You do it by using
a [StatefulWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html)
and a `setState()` method.

> ðŸ’¡ If you don't know a difference between a StatelessWidget and
> a StatefulWidget, see [Adding interactivity to your Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/interactive)

In the example, you have a `MyApp` widget that extends `StatelessWidget`
(look at line #7). To convert it into a `StatefulWidget`, click on the
`MyApp` widget, use Alt+Enter (Windows/Linux) or Option+Return (Mac)
and choose "Convert to StatefulWidget".

When you run the app now, you shouldn't see any difference. But your widget is
now prepared for changing a state!
